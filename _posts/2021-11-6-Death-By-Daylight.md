title: Death By Daylight
---

This project is inspired by [a recent NY Times podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/learning/do-you-think-it-is-time-to-get-rid-of-daylight-saving-time.html) featuring a debate over the merits of daylight saving time vs. standard time. Both sides advocated for doing away with the current US system of changing twice a year and settling upon a single time system for the entire year. But they had arrived at opposite conclusions about which time system was best. The thing that caught my attention was research cited by the neurologist arguing in favor of adopting standard time year round. He alluded to a study comparing cancer rates on the western edge of US time zones vs. the eastern edge. Cancer rates were found to be higher on the western edge, where the sun sets later. He proposed the underlying mechanism to be the "social jetlag" induced by people going to sleep later in areas where the sun sets later, but still having to wake up to meet the obligatory schedules of society whose timing is fixed (e.g., school and work start times), such that they are more chronically sleep deprived than their counterparts in areas where the sun sets earlier. Sleep deprivation has long been associated with negative health outcomes, ergo higher cancer rates for the sleepier cohort. 

I googled to learn more, and found a [2019 Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/19/how-living-wrong-side-time-zone-can-be-hazardous-your-health/) on the subject. This article reprints a beautiful visualization of average annual sunset time from the [2019 journal article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629618309718) by researchers from Pittsburgh and Switzerland.
